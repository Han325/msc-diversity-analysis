# Java Test Input Analysis Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to analyze the characteristics of string inputs within Java test files. Specifically, they measure the percentage of inputs matching a Genetic Algorithm (GA) mutation signature and calculate the diversity of inputs using pairwise distance metrics.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `result-analysis.py` (Mutation Signature Analysis)

This script analyzes the *quality* of inputs by checking if they match predefined mutation patterns. It counts the number of "semantic inputs" (strings used to create specific custom objects) and determines what percentage of them appear to be generated by simple GA mutations.

The detectable signatures are:
-   **`Plausible Long String`**: A single word repeated exactly 10 times.
-   **`Common Value Swap`**: A numeric string that is an exact match for a common commercial value (e.g., `"19.95"`, `"99.99"`).

### 2. `input-distance-analysis.py` (Input Diversity Analysis)

This script measures the *variety* of inputs by calculating the average pairwise distance between all unique inputs within a given category (e.g., `WalletNames`, `Amount`, etc.). A score closer to 1.0 indicates high diversity (inputs are very different from each other), while a score closer to 0.0 indicates low diversity (inputs are very similar).

The distance metrics used are:
-   **For strings**: Normalized Levenshtein distance.
-   **For numbers**: Normalized absolute difference.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x

## How to Use

1.  Ensure the following files are in the same directory:
    -   `result-analysis.py`
    -   `input-distance-analysis.py`
    -   `all_test_files_combined.txt` (the data file containing the Java code)

2.  Run the desired analysis from your terminal:

    -   To run the **mutation signature analysis**:
        ```bash
        python result-analysis.py
        ```
    -   To run the **input diversity analysis**:
        ```bash
        python input-distance-analysis.py
        ```

**Note**: Both scripts expect the Java source code to be in a single file named `all_test_files_combined.txt`, with each test file separated by the delimiter line `================================================================================`.
